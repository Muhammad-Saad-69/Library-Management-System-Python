# 📚 Simple Library Management System

Hi there! 👋  

This is a **basic Library Management System** I built in **Python** as my 4th semester project.  
It's intentionally kept simple so anyone can read and understand the code easily — no fancy frameworks or complex architectures here!

## 🌟 Features
- **Three user types:** Admin, Registered Users, and Guests
- **Admins:** Add/remove books and manage members
- **Users:** Borrow/return books with a shopping cart system
- **Guests:** Borrow one book at a time (must return before borrowing another)
- **Simple console-based interface**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Pure Python (no external dependencies)
- **Data Structures:** Dictionaries, Lists
- **UI:** Simple text-based console interface

---

## 🚀 How to Run
Clone the repository and run the program:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/library-management-system.git
cd library-management-system
python library_system.py
```

## 👨‍💻 Why This Project?
This project is **perfect for beginners** to understand basic Python concepts.  
It demonstrates fundamental programming principles such as:
- User authentication
- Basic CRUD operations
- Simple menu systems

Also, it serves as a **great base** for expanding with more features.

## 💡 Note
> ⚠️ This was made for **educational purposes** — it uses **plaintext passwords** and has no database (all data resets when you close the program).  

Feel free to **fork** this repo and experiment with adding new features!  

> *"Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication"* — This code proves it 😉
